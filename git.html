				I’m really sorry for hurting you. I didn’t mean to, and I feel bad about it. I know I tend to mess things up sometimes, and I feel terrible about it. I value our friendship a lot, and I promise I’ll be more careful in the future to make sure this doesn’t happen again.

				I am waiting for you to forgive me.
